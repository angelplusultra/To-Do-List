<h1>Steps to get started</h1>


1. Install project dependencies by running ```npm install``` in the CLI
2. type ```npm run dev``` in the CLI to initiate the express server that will be watched by Nodemon
3. Open your browser and navigate to ```localhost:8000```
4. Type npm run build-css to initiate the TailwindCSS compiler to watch for changes
5. If the styling of the page on ```localhost:8000``` is messed up try hitting ```CTRL + S``` in the index.ejs file to automatically run the Tailwind compiler, refresh your browser and the styles should be normal.
